# Predictive-Modelling-for-Personal-Loan-Approval
Predictive model for personal loan approval using demographic &amp; banking data. Empowering financial institutions with data-driven decision-making.

Overview


This repository contains a predictive modelling project aimed at predicting whether individuals will take a personal loan based on various demographic and banking-related attributes. The dataset used for this project includes information about customers, such as their age, income, family size, education level, and banking behavior.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of tabular data with the following columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each individual

Age: Age of the individual

Experience: Years of professional experience

Income: Annual income in thousands of dollars

ZIP Code: ZIP code of the individual's residence

Family: Size of the individual's family

CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month

Education: Level of education (1: Undergraduate, 2: Graduate, 3: Advanced/Professional)

Mortgage: Amount of mortgage in thousands of dollars

Personal Loan: Target variable indicating whether the individual took a personal loan (1: Yes, 0: No)

Securities Account: Whether the individual has a securities account (1: Yes, 0: No)

CD Account: Whether the individual has a certificate of deposit (CD) account (1: Yes, 0: No)

Online: Whether the individual uses online banking services (1: Yes, 0: No)

CreditCard: Whether the individual has a credit card (1: Yes, 0: No)



Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether an individual will take a personal loan. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify the key factors that influence a person's decision to take a loan and provide insights that can help financial institutions in targeted marketing campaigns and risk assessment.



Project Structure

Data Exploration: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks/scripts to understand the characteristics of the dataset and relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modelling.
Model Development: Building and training predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
Deployment: Deployment of the final trained model for inference on new data.
